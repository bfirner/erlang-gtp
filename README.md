erlang-gtp
==========

The go text protocol implemented in Erlang.

I wrote this a few years ago as an exercise in learning Erlang. I think
that there are a couple of bugs that I need to fix when stones are being
captured, but now that I am paying attention to the code again I should
fix them quickly.
